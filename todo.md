# Food Recognition Model Training To-Do List

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - [x] Download the Food-101 dataset from https://huggingface.co/datasets/food101/viewer/default/train?p=1.
   - [ ] Organize the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - [ ] Set up folders for each food category.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - [ ] Resize images to a consistent size.
   - [ ] Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1.
   - [ ] Augment the data by applying transformations like rotations, flips, or changes in brightness.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - [ ] Choose a pre-existing computer vision model suitable for image classification.

4. **Model Architecture:**
   - [ ] Modify the last fully connected layer of the chosen model to have the number of output classes equal to the number of food categories in Food-101.

5. **Loss Function and Optimizer:**
   - [ ] Choose a loss function appropriate for image classification preferiably CrossEntropyLoss, torch.nn.
   - [ ] Use an optimizer.

6. **Training:**
   - [ ] Split the Food-101 dataset into training and validation sets.
   - [ ] Train the model on the training set, adjusting the model's parameters based on the loss computed during validation.

7. **Evaluation:**
   - [ ] Evaluate your model on a separate test set to assess its performance.

8. **Fine-Tuning (Optional):**
   - [ ] Fine-tune your model by adjusting hyperparameters, adding more layers, or training for additional epochs to improve performance.

9. **Save the Trained Model:**
   - [ ] Save the trained model for future use.
